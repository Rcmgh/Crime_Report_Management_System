# Crime_Report_Management_System
Database Management System Project, which mainly focuses on developing an online efficient crime reporting system.
We can run CRUD Operations (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) in the Frontend, which in turn gets reflected in the backend databse.
We can run Sql queries in the backend like (Aggregate functions, SET Operations, JOIN Queries, View, Functions and Procedures, Triggers).

Frontend: Streamlit
Backend: MYSQL(using xampp server)

HOW TO RUN THE FILES:
1. Create a folder for frontend files which include:
   a.py
   app.py
   create.py
   database.py
   delete.py
   read.py
   update.py
   
2. Import the sql file and run the xampp server.
3. To run frontend files, go to the directory of the folder in the cmd, and run (py -m streamlit app.py)
